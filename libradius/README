This libradius library implements the client side of the Remote
Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS). RADIUS, defined in RFCs
2138 and 2139, allows clients to perform authentication and accounting
by means of network requests to remote servers.

This software was originally written by John Polstra, and donated to the
FreeBSD project by Juniper Networks, Inc. Oleg Semyonov subsequently
added the ability to perform RADIUS accounting.
